# Sticky

Sticky is a simple, key/value pair, browser-storage cache leveraging the latest HTML5 storage API's. Sticky persists to memory, indexedDB, webSQL, localStorage, globalStorage, and cookies. Objects and arrays are stringified before storage, and strings longer than 128 characters aren't persisted to cookies.

#### Features

* Tiny and fast
* Callbacks for everything
* Store strings, numbers, and objects â€“ JSON in and JSON out
* Simple abstraction for IndexedDB and WebSQL's complexity
* MIT licensed

## Storage Mechanisms and Browser Support

* **WebSQL (SQLite)**  
Chrome 4+, Opera 10.5+, Safari 3.1+, and Android Browser 2.1+
5MB of data per DB, but can request more
* **IndexedDB**  
IE 10+, FireFox 4+, and Chrome 11+
* **localStorage**  
Safari 4+, Mobile Safari (iPhone/iPad), Firefox 3.5+, Internet Explorer 8+ and Chrome 4+
5MB of data per domain
* **globalStorage**  
FireFox 2-3
* **Cookies**  
Usually 1-4KB per domain. Only strings that are less than 128 characters are persisted to cookies by Sticky.

## Usage

#### HTML:

    <script src="sticky-0.5.js" type="text/javascript"></script>

#### JavaScript:

    // Initialize your store and repopulate cached data
    var store = new StickyStore();

    // Set
    store.set('color', 'red');

    // Get
    store.get('color');

    // Remove
    store.remove('color');

### Initialize a store

First, you must create a sticky store object like so:

    var store = new StickyStore();

Alternatively, you can specify some options for this store by passing the opts argument:

    var store = new StickyStore({
        name: 'Store A',       // Unique identifier for this store. Required to use multiple stores.
        version: '1.0',        // Version for this store.
        ready: function() {},  // Fires after cache has been repopulated.
        domain: 'example.com', // Custom cookie domain.
        expires: 48,           // Hours. Used for cookie expiration.
        size: 5                // indexedDB / webSQL database size in megabytes.
    });

When you initialize a store, its cache will be repopulated from browser storage. Because indexedDB and webSQL operate asynchronously, Sticky will fire the ```store.opts.ready``` function after the cache has been repopulated.

### Multiple Stores

Cached data is specific to a store's ```name``` and ```version``` options. Sticky supports multiple stores by prefixing the key values with the name and version.

### Get

Returns the cached value or null if it isn't found. Example:

    store.get('something');

You can also specify a default value for failure:

    store.get('something', 'not there'); // Returns "not there" instead of false

And callbacks!

    store.get('something', callback(val) {
        console.log(val);
    });

### Set

Caches a value and returns the cached value or false on error. You can pass any type of value: String, array, object, and number. Objects and arrays will be stringified and prefixed with ```J::O``` for storage. String values longer than 128 characters will not be persisted to cookies.

You can set strings or numbers:

    store.set('color', 'red');

    store.set('version', 5);

Or objects:

    store.set('car', {
        make: 'Volkswagen',
        model: 'Golf GTI',
        year: 2001
    });

You can also specify a callback:

    store.set('color', 'red', function(val) {
        console.log(val); // Outputs "red"
    });

### Remove

Removes the cached value from this store from all storage mechanisms and returns true if successful. ```remove``` also takes an optional callback function as the second argument.

    store.remove('something');

### Remove All

Removes all cached values for this store from all storage mechanisms. ```removeAll``` also takes an optional callback function as the second argument.

    store.removeAll();
